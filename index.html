    <details>
    <summary>Role Discussions</summary>
      <p>We looked into splitting into subteams based on our individual skills. 
        Currently mainly deciding on whether <br>each person wants to do frontend or 
        backend related tasks. We also discussed if anyone had particular skills 
        <br>with tools like Node, Mongo, SQL, etc. in order to better determine what 
        teams we could go into. However, <br>there was also general confusion about 
        what our project actually is and how our team setup would even work <br>with 
        that.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Establishing Team Rules</summary>
      <p>We discussed team rules, what method of communication we are using (slack), 
        communication curtsey, etc. <br>Everyone agreed to the rules and there were no 
        disputes overall. Importantly, the <i>strike system</i> was introducted <br>as a way to 
        keep ourselves accountable and everyone was informed of it.</p>
    </details>

        <h3>Branding:</h3>
        <p>General confusion about what the actual project is so everyone was unsure 
          as to what directrion to go <br>in with branding. Current idea is that we focus 
          on 3 issues on campus, e.g. mental health, housing prices, <br>etc. Then split 
          into teams to build tools for those things. Then we discussed simplifying 
          and condensing <br>this idea down to just one or two of those things. Financial 
          literacy was decided on in the case that we <br>are meant to build a webapp 
          around it.</p>
        <h3>Name:</h3>
        <p>The team name we decided on was <strong>Triton Financial Solutions</strong>
          as a satirical take on other startups. <br>Hoping for some startup vibes with 
          logo and 
          presentation/branding.</p>
        <h3>Color:</h3>
        <p>Blue and yellow, use the UCSD colors because its UCSD related.</p>
        <h3>Logo:</h3>
        <p>A coin like thing with yellow coin and a symbol in the middle, something 
          simple.</p>
        <img src="images/logo.png" alt="TRITON FINANCIAL SERVICES LOGO" width="500" height="500">
        <h3>Mascot:</h3>
        <p>Off brand monopoly man, king triton with money in hand?</p>
        <h3>Important Values:</h3>
        <p>Financial literacy, how to save money, how to spend less, advocating for 
          lower housing prices, etc.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Team Page</summary>
      <p>Discussed and everyone is just adding their part to the github page.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Team Video</summary>
      <p>We discussed making a video with all members, introducing each person with 
        our team name, then individual <br>introductions. Shoot part of it at statue at 
        UCSD then record individual parts. Did not go with all in person <br>video because 
        of background noise concerns. Send to Sarena to edit. Each person records for 
        15 seconds with <br>Name, Major, Hobby.</p>
